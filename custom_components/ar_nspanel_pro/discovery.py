"""Shared active-discovery probe (PLAN.md §3.6).

This is the ONE legitimately cross-panel operation: it publishes on the shared
``ar-nspanel-pro/panel/discover`` topic and collects replies from every online panel
on ``ar-nspanel-pro/panel/+/sys/discovery``, while also picking up retained
``avail`` / ``sys/info`` so panels that are online-but-quiet are still listed.

Used by the config flow (to offer a pick-list) and by the ``discover`` service.
