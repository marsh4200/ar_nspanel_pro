"""Giving the panel's player something to throw away.

**The problem, measured on the device (2026-07-21).** The NSPanel's MediaPlayer
drops roughly the last 0.3 s of EVERY clip it plays: a 1.63 s TTS phrase is heard
as "…il ci" instead of "…il ciclo", a 2.12 s one stops at "…, gra", and even the
bundled 18.55 s ``alarmo.mp3`` — which never goes near a network or a TTS engine
— comes back ~0.3 s short. It is not the streaming proxy (a static file served
from a laptop behaves identically), not ``react-native-sound-player`` (its
completion handler only emits an event), and not Home Assistant.

**Why TTS suffers most.** Piper renders a clip that ends exactly on the last
sample: ffmpeg finds no trailing silence anywhere in it, and no punctuation
trick adds any (``.``, ``...``, ``, ,`` all render the same length). So the
player's missing tail comes straight out of the final word.

**The fix.** Append silence to the clip before the panel ever sees it, so the
0.3 s it discards is silence instead of a syllable. MP3 frames are
self-describing and simply concatenate, so this is a byte append — no ffmpeg at
runtime, no re-encode, no measurable delay.

The padded clip is served from memory by :class:`PanelClipView` under a random
token, exactly like HA's own ``tts_proxy`` serves unauthenticated audio. It is
short-lived by design: the panel plays on receipt and never re-fetches, so
nothing here needs to survive a restart.
