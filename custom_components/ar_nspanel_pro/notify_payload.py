"""Building a ``cmd/notify`` payload — shared by the service and the config UI.

There are two front-ends for notifications (the ``ar_nspanel_pro.notify``
service and the config panel's Notify composer, over the WebSocket API) and
exactly one payload shape. This module is that shape, so the two cannot drift:
the field names, the ``timeout`` → ``timeoutS`` rename, the action shorthand,
and the rule that ``speak`` wins over ``sound`` all live here.
